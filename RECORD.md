##Day 1, June 19th Progress:
Morning: We sat down to rite out our speck, our proposal and do a sketch of our proposed site.
Almost by instinct, we decided to work on Bookbag, our simple book reccomendation website.
We all made wireframes by hand and for the mobile website first, then desktop. Tinytort's design of the website is the best.

### Afternoon:
We sat down to look into the following API's
1. Amazon -- While Amazon could solve our problems quickly, nobody wanted to pay $30 a month for it. We're all too dang poor for that. It also seems to use XML more. Ew.
..* UPDATE: Apparently they misunderstood the prompts. We may be able to use it after all. They only have to pay if they go over 1 million hits a month. I think we'll be OK. TasteDive still seems like less hassle.
2. Google Books - Impressive API. It does allow us to find ISBN
3. TasteDive - We thankfully found TasteDive as a replacement for Amazon. While not perfect, it will give us a free API key and return similar books/titles/authors as JSON instead of XML. We are limited to 150 searches/hr
4. [ISBNdb] (http://isbndb.com/api/v2/docs)  - This could still prove useful. And free, from what I can tell.

Thankfully, we had the great Amy, a CodeFellows mentor, to come in and help us out ith troubleshooting and push us in the right direction.
I hope that we can use a combination of the TasteDive [TD] call and Google API [GAPI] to ping a book title, grab the first two results that aren't the same as the original query and then use GAPI's embed feature to load up a potential book. Or at least the first few pages.
  So yeah, we seem to be on the right track. Planning today, working on building tomorrow.

  Amy has been an invaluable help. A shame she won't be available until Wednesday. But at least that we have a written diagram and a clear plan of attack for tomorrow.
