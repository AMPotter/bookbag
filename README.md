BÃ¶okbag is a simple app. You tell it what you're reading and it gives you similar books for you to enjoy.

## NAMES: *The Bookbag team consists of Haley Tortorella, Andrew Potter, and Anwar Montasir.*

## PITCH:
 __The Bookbag team wishes to make reading simple and fun again. Options can be overwhelming! We want to make a single-page application that takes in a book title and returns books of similar nature, without social networking or shopping. The target is people who are already in a bookstore and want viable alternatives for books they like or are already considering.__
 __Our plan involves using the TasteDive API to search by book title and make recomendations for the reader. We will also include the option of saving books to a database for future reference.__
