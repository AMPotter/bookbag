# bookbag
BÃ¶okbag is a simple app. You tell it what you're reading and it gives you two similar books for you to enjoy.

## NAMES: *The Bookbag team consists of Haley Tortorella, Andrew Potter, and Anwar Montasir. The goal is to pare down giant lists and keep reading suggestions fun and simple.*

## PITCH:
 __The Bookbag team wishes to make reading simple and fun again. Options can be overwhelming! We want to make a single-page application that takes in a book title and returns two books of similar nature. The target is for people who are already in a bookstore and want two viable alternatives for book they like or are already considering.__
 __Our plan involves using the Amazon API and possibly the Google Books or iDreambooks API. The Amazon API will be used to fetch book data requests and additional "Soso also bought $someBook" to make reccomendations for the reader.__
